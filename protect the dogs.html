	Much of the world views dogs as trusted companions or protectors, but in some parts of Asia, they suffer as victims of the trade in dog meat for human consumption.

			HSI is one of the leading global organizations working in countries across Asia to end the grisly dog meat trade. They provide funding to train officials for improved enforcement of laws; help local partner groups on the ground with veterinary and shelter care for confiscated animals; raise global awareness of the suffering involved in illegal dog theft, transport and slaughter, including at Chinaâ€™s annual Dog Meat Festival in Yulin; expose the horror of subterranean killing pits in Nagaland in India; and work with dog meat farmers in South Korea to transition them to more humane ways of making a living. They also helped form the Asia Canine Protection Alliance to end the illegal trade of dogs from Thailand, Cambodia and Laos into Viet Nam and the Dog Meat-Free Indonesia campaign to stop this cruelty in Indonesia.

			By drawing the attention of governments and the public to the cruelty involved in this industry, we hope to put a stop to the misery these dogs endure.
